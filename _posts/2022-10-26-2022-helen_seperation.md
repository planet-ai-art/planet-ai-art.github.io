**Seperation**<br/>
by Helen W.<br/>

This submission is for the 2022 Planet+AI Image Challenge themed on *Imagining Mars Sample Return*.   

The top part of the Mars Ascent Vehicle opens so that the collected Martian samples can be loaded into the sample return capsule for retrieval by the Earth Return Orbiter.
