**Copter Flying on Mars**<br/>
by Alice Z.<br/>

This submission is for the 2022 Planet+AI Image Challenge themed on *Imagining Mars Sample Return*.   

According to the current plan, two Ingenuity-like helicopters will be as backup for the Perseverance to deliver collected samples to the Sample Retrieval Lander.
